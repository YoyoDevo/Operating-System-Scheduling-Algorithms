The purpose of this project is to write a java program that simulates an operating system. 

The program implements the following CPU scheduling algorithms. 

1.	First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)
2.	Shortest-Job-First (SJF)
3.	Round-Robin with time slice = 2 (RR-2)
4.	Round-Robin with time slice = 5 (RR-5)

The program will read process burst times from a file (job.txt)
